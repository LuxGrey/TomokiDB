# TomokiDB
TomokiDB is a desktop-application with the goal to help with storage and organization of web links.

Planned core-features are:
* grouping multiple links together to a shared identity
* creating tags and assigning them to identities
* assigning multiple aliases to identities
* searching for identities based on aliases and tags

## How to run
Run the application with

`mvn clean javafx:run`

## Possible applications
The idea for this project came from the desire to make organizing internet browser bookmarks that point to profiles of digital artists easier,
and thus it can be used for that.

Are there online content creators whose content you take interest in, with their content being posted to multiple platforms?
Does some of their content only appear on platform A and different content on platform B?
What if you only followed them on one platform, and their profile there is no longer available?
Do you want to search your collection of bookmarks for every creator that is part of a desired category?

If you have concerns like these, then TomokiDB might be for you.
